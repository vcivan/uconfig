# uconfig

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

I am a machine learning engineer and I work with configs a lot. I've always wanted a Python config package that would offer the following 3 features:
 * the possibility to work with a widely used format, e.g. json or yaml (this package will work with json)
 * the autocomplete feature when using the config attributes in my IDE of choice (VSCode)
 * the possibility to change any number of the config attributes from the command line when running my Python scripts without adding any boilerplate code (this will be done under the hood by the package using argparse)

 Therefore, this Python package will do exactly that for you. The name *uconfig* stands for *useful config* (I know, it took a lot of inspiration to find that name :) )
